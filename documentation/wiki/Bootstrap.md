## Quick Intro
The document describes the logic behind the bootstrap and testing capabilities for the fresh MSBuild bits.

## History
MSBuild supports two different environments: .NET and .NET Framework. To test changes for .NET, fresh bits were published (the actual target Publish run) to the MSBuild.Bootstrap folder. These bits, along with specific dependencies, were later copied to the bootstrap, making them ready for use with dotnet.exe. The executable is part of the .dotnet folder.

## Current Implementation for .NET
During the bootstrap phase, install-scripts are used to download the bits compatible with the current version. The logic for interacting with the scripts has been encapsulated in a separate MSBuild task: InstallDotNetCoreTask.cs. Hereâ€™s what happens under the hood:

The SDK is downloaded to the bootstrap folder.
Fresh MSBuild bits are then copied to this folder.
The constructed SDK is used for both local end-to-end tests and CI runs.

## Potential Cons
The reliance on downloading the SDK from a remote source requires an internet connection. For the initial build of the repository, this doesn't change as the SDK is always downloaded to the .dotnet folder first. However, for subsequent runs, the SDK will need to be downloaded again, which could be problematic in environments with limited or no internet connectivity.

## Pros
This approach simplifies testing MSBuild as part of dotnet by providing a ready and reliable environment without needing to patch anything into a globally installed SDK, as was previously required.
